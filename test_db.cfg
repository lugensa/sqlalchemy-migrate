# test_db.cfg
# 
# This file contains a list of connection strings which will be used by 
# database tests. Tests will be executed once for each string in this file. 
# You should be sure that the database used for the test doesn't contain any
# important data. See README for more information.
# 
# The string '__tmp__' is substituted for a temporary file in each connection
# string. This is useful for sqlite tests.
